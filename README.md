Hello! This is a collection of machine learning ipython notebooks I have written or worked on. 
These notebooks assume no machine learning experience, and minimal python experience.

These notebooks are designed to give a high level overview of a wide breadth of machine learning topics, beginning with the fundamentals.
The recommended order to go through these notebooks are:
1. Intro to Machine Learning
2. k-Nearest Neighbors
3. Bias Variance Tradeoff
4. Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning
5. Intro to Neural Networks

Feel free to email me at prc@berkeley.edu if you have any questions, or if you see any errors.
