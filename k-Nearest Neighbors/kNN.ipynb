    "# Introduction\n",
    "The tutorial is centered around the third project from Data 8 Fall 2017. This project involves classifying a movie's genre as either action or romance using k-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classification vs Regression\n",
    "In general, there are two major types of machine learning problems, classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Classification* is a problem where we would like to *classify* some sample input into a class or category. For example, we could classify the genre of a movie or classify a handwritten digit as $0-9$. The input may be a list of **features**, or *qualities* of a sample (for digits this would the individual pixels of the image), and the output is a class or label. Note that the bins are discrete and often categorical, and there are a finite number of classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling classification problems, this may involve generating a probability for each class, and selecting the class with the highest probability. In this notebook, we will investigate a simpler model, using a method called *k-nearest neighbors*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Regression* does not depend on distinct classes for labels. The input is still a set of features, but the output is instead a continuous value. This may be predicting the population in $5$ years or the temperature tomorrow. In this situation, the \"right answer\" is more vague. If we predict the temperature to be $70$ degrees tomorrow but it is actually $71$, are we right? What if we predicted $70.5$ degrees? This adds a layer of complexity between regression and classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling regression problems this may be done by creating some function approximation in terms of the input. For example, linear regression is the simplest model, and outputs a continuous value. There are more complex models such as *neural networks* that act as universal function approximators."

    "# k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "The **k-Nearest Neighbors** (kNN) algorithm is one of the simplest models. The core idea is that a similar set of features should have the same label. For example if we receive an image $A$ as input where we would like to classify the digit, we could look at what other images look like $A$ in our training set. If we were doing $5$-nearest neighbors, we would find the $5$ images closest to $A$ in our data set, and return the most common digit among the $5$. In general, you may choose any value for $k$, $5$ may not be the best choice. Note, this has a $O(1)$ training time! This is the fastest algorithm for training, as there is no training!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some questions immediately arise. How do you determine how close two images are? Why choose $5$, not $10$ or $100$? There are other consequences as well; you need to look through your entire dataset each time to determine the $k$ closest images, which could take a long time if your training set is huge. The prediction time for kNN is $O(n)$, which is much slower than something like linear regression, where the prediction is $O(d)$ where $d$ is the number of dimensions of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will address these questions and the shortcomings of kNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few conceptual questions for understanding:\n",
    "1. In binary classification (two classes), why is choosing an odd value for $k$ better than an even value?\n",
    "2. Given two separate ordered pairs of two values, $(a,b)$ and $(x,y)$, what possibilities are there for calculating the \"distance\" between them? What are the differences between approaches?\n",
    "3. Assume we are doing image classification. List any possible issues with image classification.\n",
    "4. What does 1-NN mean? If we have $n$ training data, what is $n$-NN? What are some of the *tradeoffs* for varying $k$ between $1$ and $n$?"
